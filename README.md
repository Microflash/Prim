[![Regression tests](https://github.com/Microflash/compris/actions/workflows/regression.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Microflash/compris/actions/workflows/regression.yml)

A [Vale](https://vale.sh)-compatible prose style for non-native English speakers. Tailored for technical documentation.

## Guiding principles

- Use short sentences (< 30 words).
- Use active voice in simple present tense.
- Avoid Latin to prevent a yet another language in the mix. Use English equivalents. 
- Use an apostrophe only to indicate a possessive.
- Avoid contractions.
